# React: Call Child Functions from Parent Functional Component 

This repository is a practical implementation of the concept discussed in the blog post "React: Call Child Functions from Parent Functional Component" available on [Abrahamberg's Blog](https://www.abrahamberg.com/blog/react-call-child-functions-from-parent-functional-component/). It provides a hands-on example to demonstrate how a parent component in React can call a function in a child component, a common yet sometimes challenging pattern in React development.

## Goal of This Repository

The primary goal of this repository is to offer a live, editable example to accompany the theoretical concepts discussed in the blog. It includes a simple React application built with Next.js, showcasing the parent-child communication pattern in React. The components of discussion, `ChatComponent` and `ParentComponent`, can be found in the `src/components` directory. 

For a detailed explanation of the code and the concepts behind it, please refer to the [main article on Abrahamberg's Blog](https://www.abrahamberg.com/blog/react-call-child-functions-from-parent-functional-component/).
